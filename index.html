# About Me

Hi, my name is Yuyi. Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student at [UC Davis](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/graduate), 
where Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by [Amanda Raybuck](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~araybuck/). I did my undergrad at Davis as well (yes, I never left). I majored in Computer Science with a Math minor, 
mostly because I liked proving things wrong using counterexamples. 

My research interests include memory systems and emerging memory technologies, hardware side-channel, 
and the power-efficiency trade-offs in large-scale system design.

Apart from research, I split my time between biking and playing questionable notes on my electric bass when I think no oneâ€™s listening. Itâ€™s jazz. Probably;)
I occasionally open [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) just to scroll past problems I donâ€™t understand. 
If you're into math elegance (or masochism), here's [21 proofs of Eulerâ€™s formula](https://ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/) that I find interesting.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about systems, jazz, or jazzy systems.


# Projects

**Software Prefetcher for Tiered Memory systems**  

   Designing adaptive prefetching heuristics for DRAMâ€“CXL hybrid memory systems, guided by ML workload semantics.

**CPU Print (Hardware Fingerprinting)**
    
   Leading the ML pipeline for robust browser fingerprinting using DVFS-induced timing signatures in CPU.

**FairMem (QoS-Aware Tiered Memory)**

  Optimizing DRAMâ€“NVM allocation fairness in multi-tenant systems through dynamic page migration and latency analysis.

**gem5 GPU Simulation Library**

  Created a modular GPU frontend library for gem5, enabling high-fidelity and reproducible simulation of GPU workloads.
